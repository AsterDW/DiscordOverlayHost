# DiscordOverlayHost
Host Manager application to capture Discord game overlays.

The program provides an OpenGL and DirectX "game" window that Discord can be pointed to to put the in game overlay on to. With the overlay in place you can then capture the host window as a game capture, or window capture within streaming/recording software to put voice channel activity onto the video output.

See the YouTube video at the following address for an example on how to use the application.
